* running athena in parallel
  
  you can speed up your simulations by running athena in /parallel/,
  basically splitting up your simulation domain into N equal-sized
  chunks and then running each one on a separate processor.  on each
  of these chunks, the boundary conditions come from the simulation
  running on the neighboring processor.  athena uses something called
  MPI (message passing interface) to communicate information among
  processors.  i would recommend /not/ looking into the details of MPI
  unless you have to.

  to do this, you first have to re-compile athena with MPI enabled

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./configure --with-gas=hydro --with-problem=... --enable-mpi
  $ make all
  #+END_EXAMPLE
